    "name": "Mormesk the Wraith",
    "description": "A spectral figure shrouded in darkness, Mormesk appears as a translucent, ghostly form of what was once a powerful human wizard. His ethereal robes billow in an unseen wind, and his eyes burn with centuries of hatred and bitterness. His incorporeal form radiates an aura of cold malevolence.",
    "personality": "Bitter, hateful, and consumed by anger over his death and inability to possess his treasures. Despite his wrathful nature, he retains the intellectual capacity and magical knowledge from his life as a powerful wizard. He is territorial about his former quarters and obsessed with the wealth he can no longer touch.",
    "currentScene": "The ruined Wizards' Quarters in Wave Echo Cave, a room scarred by ancient battle magic. The walls are blackened, furniture is charred and splintered, and a scorched iron chest - his greatest torment - stands mockingly at the foot of a bed.",
    "gameContext": "Lost Mine of Phandelver (LMOP) - Wave Echo Cave. Mormesk leads the undead that haunt the cave and has a particular rivalry with the delusional spectator guarding the Forge of Spells. He was one of the last wizards to die in the spell battle during the bandit attack centuries ago.",

The wraith's form is ethereal and ghostly, with glowing eyes filled with malevolence. The background shows scorched walls, splintered furniture, and a prominent iron chest. The lighting should be cold and ethereal, emphasizing the wraith's spectral nature. Style: Dark fantasy art with strong atmospheric lighting and detailed textures.",
