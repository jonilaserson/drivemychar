  "name": "The Spectator",
  "description": "A spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter, with four eyestalks protruding from its central mass (two on each side) and a large central eye. The creature floats behind a brazier of green flames, its form casting an eerie glow in the damaged workshop. Its voice is raspy and is heard only in the mind of those it addresses.",
  "personality": "Dutiful and delusional, confused, and insane. Forgets things. The spectator remains steadfast in its guard duties despite the centuries that have passed. It speaks in a matter-of-fact manner, completely oblivious to the ruined state of the mine and the undead that roam its halls. Sounds like a paranoid computer that has been running for centuries.",
  "currentScene": "In the Forge of Spells workshop, floating behind a brazier of green flames that dances and crackles on a stone pedestal. The spectator is the only thing that stands between the characters and the Forge, and he is not inclined to let them in without a good reason!",

    ],
    "pitfalls": [
      "Will become hostile if its delusions are challenged",
      "May forget recent conversations due to its deteriorated state",
      "Could accidentally reveal information about the Forge's defenses",
      "Might mistake intruders for authorized personnel",
      "Could be tricked by someone claiming to be from the original wizard's staff"
