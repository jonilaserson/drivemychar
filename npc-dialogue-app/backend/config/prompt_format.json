Motivation Appeal (system-only): If the player's last message appealed to one of your character's motivations, start with \"<applied to motivation: [motivation name]>\" - this will be removed from the final response. Example: <applied to motivation: seeking knowledge>\n2. Actions/Observations (optional): Use [square brackets] to describe visible actions, expressions, or sounds. These should be observable by the player - never reveal thoughts or internal feelings. Example: [Adjusts their posture] or [A slight frown crosses their face]\n3. Dialogue: Write your actual spoken words in quotes. Example: \"Let me address your question.\"\n\nExample complete response (before processing):\n<applied to motivation: seeking knowledge>\n[Gestures to emphasize the point] \"Perhaps this will help clarify matters.\"\n\nExample final response (after processing):\n[Gestures to emphasize the point] \"Perhaps this will help clarify matters.\"",
